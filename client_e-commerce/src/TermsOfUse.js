                   <li>You place an order for products or services:</li>
                   <ul>
                       <li>a. Online Orders: when you press the 'Pay Now' button at the end of the online checkout process.</li>

                   <li>You will be given the opportunity to confirm the details of your order, including your address and payment details, prior to completing your order.</li>
                   <li>When you place an order, we will send you an acknowledgement email to let you know that we have received your order. This is not an order confirmation or acceptance. We will request pre-authorisation against your payment card at this stage.</li>
                   <li>We will send you a confirmation email to confirm that your order has been dispatched for delivery. This is confirmation and acceptance of your order. Your payment card will be charged on dispatch.</li>
                   <li>Unless otherwise agreed, your order will be delivered within 30 days of confirmation of your order (please see our Delivery and Returns page for more information on our standard delivery times). Where we are unable to deliver your order within this period, we reserve the right to cancel your order.</li>
                   <li>We may contact you if we cannot accept your order, which may be the result of (i) the products not being available, (ii) there is a problem with your payment method, (iii) there has been a pricing or product description error on the website, (iv) we are unable to deliver the products due to local import restrictions or requirements at your delivery destination or (v) you donâ€™t meet our eligibility to order criteria or are in breach of any of the Terms and Conditions or other law.</li>
                   <li>The contract will be concluded in English.</li>
               </ul>
               <h4>Delivery</h4>
               <p>Different delivery policies and options apply depending on how you place your order and where your order is being delivered. Please visit the Delivery and Returns page or our FAQs for further information.</p>
               <p>Deliveries will be carried out by third party couriers.</p>   
               <p>It is your responsibility to comply with all requirements imposed by local Customs authorities in relation to your order (including requirements regarding the provision of identification information in order to receive your order). We recommend that you make yourself aware of local import duties and any other requirements before placing your order.</p>
               <p>If the product(s) you are ordering contain(s) certain exotic animal skins or fur, and are being delivered outside of Europe, your delivery will take longer (by approximately 20 days on top of the destination's standard delivery time), as we have to obtain licences for the export and import of the products in accordance with international treaties. Certain countries may also require other certification or information in order for your order to be delivered, which again may delay your delivery (by approximately 7 days on top of the destination's standard delivery time). If we are unable to obtain the relevant documentation required for your delivery, we may need to cancel your order.</p>
               <h4>Returns</h4>
               <p>In addition to your Statutory Rights, Harrods offers the following rights of return:</p>
               <p>Unwanted products may be returned for a refund or exchange if they are returned unused and in their original condition. Please note that the removal of security tags will be taken as evidence of use of a product by you and the product cannot be returned in these circumstances.</p>
               <p>Returns must be made within 14 days with proof of purchase and are subject to exclusions and restrictions that are listed below (please note Non-Returnable Products below). If you need to return large or heavy items, please contact our Customer Service team.</p>
               <p>If the products have decreased in value due to the way you have handled them, we may deduct the amount of such loss from the amount reimbursed to you. If you are returning your product by post, please include your personal details and the best way for us to get in touch with you, otherwise we will be unable to process your refund. </p>
               <p>Refunds and exchanges on purchases made on an event day or with other promotional discount will be calculated at the reduced price. Where a complimentary gift has been issued with a purchase, the gift must also be returned.</p>            
               <p>If you believe your products are faulty, please contact our Customer Service team.</p>
